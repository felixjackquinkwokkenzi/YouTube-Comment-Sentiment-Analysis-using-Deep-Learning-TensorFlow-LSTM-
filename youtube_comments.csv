I have came back here after 3 years to start again and i feel more ambitious than ever to start a career in programming. I want to start my own computer/software company like Microsoft and I feel unstoppable. This man is going to kickstart my career. (Lets just say im very young)
Hey the Dictionaries exercise seems to break when I input more than 5 characters. I tried my full phone number and it it breaks down into a loop of the unaccepted symbol and a couple random dictionary entries. It doesn't happen with brackets though.
"Challenge of f using nested loop

list = [1]
list2 = [5, 2, 5, 2, 2]   
for i in list:
	for j in list2:
		print('x' *j)
	
		#OR
print('\n\n\n\n')# make space so that the two f can be seen easily
for i in range(1):
	for j in list2:
		print('x' *j)"

start - to start the car
stop - to stop the car
quit - to exit

"sir there is some confusion , I copied the same code you done in nested loop class in my pycharm but its result is different , when I write the code so from range it produce first one X and then xx and then xxx means it make out the range of 5 then 2 then 5 and then 2 and 2 
so how can I fix this problem to make same the result as your like for 5,2,5,22 it then will give XXXXX, XX ,XXXXX, XX, XX . please help"

"I appreciate all his videos.
More power to you Sir"
"Thank you for this tutorial, very easy to learn and follow.

I'm on my second rewatch and currently on the 4 hours mark where you started the first automation project with openpyxl.

The link to download the spreadsheet file isn't currently working. Perhaps, the link has been broken or the filed removed?

Rectifying it would really help out the viewers, especially the new ones who would find this video in the future.

Again, thank you very much for this easy to follow tutorial."

Studing to become data sci
"00:04 Learn Python programming for building applications, websites, automation, AI, and more
06:52 In this Python tutorial, you will learn about variables and how they store data in computer memory.
20:32 Python code that asks questions and prints messages based on user input
27:16 The input function in Python always returns a string, so numerical values need to be converted to integers or floats.
40:40 Python has built-in methods to manipulate strings
47:32 In Python, strings can be manipulated using len, upper, lower, title, find, replace, and in operator
1:00:52 If statements help in executing code based on conditions.
1:07:44 Comparison operators and logical operators in Python
1:21:44 Use a while loop and conditions to ask the user to make a guess in a guessing game
1:28:16 Build a game simulation engine
1:41:44 Python for loops are used to iterate over items in a collection.
1:48:20 Nested loops can be used to generate coordinates and shapes
2:01:00 Two dimensional lists in python and list methods
2:07:36 Lists in Python have several methods to add, remove, check, sort, and copy items.
2:20:48 Accessing and updating values in a dictionary in Python
2:27:28 Break code into smaller functions for better organization and reusability.
2:40:52 Most of the time, use positional arguments. Use keyword arguments to improve code readability when dealing with numerical values. Keyword arguments should come after positional arguments.
2:47:32 By default, all functions in Python return None. You can change that by using the return statement.
3:01:08 Comments should be used to explain whys and hows, not obvious things.
3:08:00 Creating new types using classes and constructors
3:21:36 Modules help organize code and can be imported in different ways.
3:28:20 Overwriting built-in functions in Python is considered a bad practice
3:41:48 Create a class called dice with a method called row that returns a tuple of two random values.
3:48:28 You can use the glob method to search for files and directories in a given path.
4:01:20 Add a new column with corrected prices and create a chart.
4:07:52 Automation of spreadsheet updating process using python.
4:20:24 Learn how to load a csv data set in Jupiter
4:26:44 Using Jupyter shortcuts to improve coding efficiency
4:39:48 Building a model that makes accurate predictions is not always easy

"Im a absolute beginner and watched many videos on youtube but when i came to this code 
""I hope i will learn every thing becz i not started the video yet""😮‍💨"
"Challenge in 1:51:30 in less code:
list = [5, 2, 5, 2, 2]
for i in list:
    print(""x""*i)

Explanation:
1- We create a list with the values of the video
2- We make a for loop assigning i to the values in list, so in the first iteration i = 5, in the second iteration i = 2... and so on😮‍💨
3- The challenge is to print times x according to the value of the list so we just need to print(""x""*i)🤔

Benefits:
The code in the video uses a time complexity of O(n²), which basically means that it will take more time because they are two for loops, in this code you just use one for loop so the time complexity will be O(n), which means that it will take less time to run the code 😜

If you liked the explanation give me a like plis 😭🙏"

"Thanks for the tutorial and encouraging to learn python, i am just a starter in learning python.
I work as Cloud Operations engineer, and want to learn python to automate some basic stuff on AWS cloud.
I am aware that i need to learn boto3 library for my use case, but i am looking for the correct direction which i can apply in my current job immediately.

Can you suggest me some best practices to learn python+git+aws for basic automation?

One of the use case:
Write a script that can terminate set of ec2 instances based on custom tags.
Read multiple files from AWS S3 bucket in different location and search for specific string.
Etc.

Although i just completed an hour of this video, just wanted to appreciate how helpful and informative your content is.

"Python instead of JavaScript!
 Without installing the Python language interpreter

      Just copy this file ie pyscript.js next to your html file.  And then call it in the page like this:

 <script  src ="" pyscript.js "" > 
 </script>

 Now you can easily use Python commands inside the script tag:

 <script>
     name = input (""Enter name: "")
     print ( ""Hello "" + name )
 </script> 

     You are aware that print or input are not javascript commands, but now they are running beautifully!  And of course, this interpreter is completely written with JavaScript!
    Of course, the output should be seen in the Console section of the browser.  But if you want to display it on the web page, just write the final output to the same JavaScript.  For example, in this example it goes up:
 document.write (""Hello "" + name )

     If you need additional information, you can refer to his website:

Python is a popular programming language used for automation, AI, and building web applications. The tutorial covers installing Python and a code editor, creating a simple Python program, and using variables, strings, and arithmetic operations. It also introduces concepts like functions, error handling, and modules. The tutorial aims to teach Python programming from scratch.


Key moments:
13:08 In this Python tutorial, you will learn about variables, a fundamental concept in programming used to store data in a computer's memory, essential in Python and other languages.
          -The tutorial covers the process of downloading and installing Python on a computer, ensuring compatibility with the latest version and necessary settings for successful installation.
          -The instructor introduces PyCharm as a popular code editor for Python, explaining its features and guiding the viewers through downloading and setting it up for coding.
          -The tutorial progresses to teaching basic Python programming, including creating a simple program to print text and visual elements like a dog using print statements and expressions.
15:04 Python allows defining variables with different data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans. It's crucial to understand data types to avoid errors and perform operations correctly in Python programming.
          -Understanding different data types in Python such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Knowing the importance of setting variables correctly to avoid errors and ensure accurate operations.
          -Exploring the concept of case sensitivity in Python and the significance of using lowercase letters for variables. Highlighting the special keywords like 'true' and 'false' in Python programming.
          -Learning about receiving user input in Python using the 'input' function and printing customized messages. Understanding the functions built into Python for common tasks like printing and input handling.
30:08 Understanding the usage of single and double quotes in Python strings is crucial for avoiding syntax errors. Utilizing formatted strings with placeholders makes it easier to visualize and manipulate text output efficiently.
          -Differentiating between single and double quotes in Python strings to prevent syntax errors. Utilizing double quotes to include single quotes within a string.
          -Exploring the use of triple quotes for defining multi-line strings in Python, allowing for more extensive text formatting and readability.
          -Utilizing square brackets and index manipulation to extract specific characters or substrings from a string in Python, including negative indexing for accessing characters from the end of the string.
45:12 The tutorial covers string manipulation in Python, including methods like find, replace, and using the 'in' operator to check for characters or"

"1:30:37 when I get interested in a game and I see the code, as a new phyton learner I try to make my own version of that game.
So here is my guessing game, kind of the same but with a few tweaks

Secret_number = 10
Guess_count = 0
Guess_limit = 3

Player = input('''Hello Player, this is a guessing game. Simply guess a number and you win. 

Are you ready? Yes or No? ''')

if Player == ""Yes"":
    print('Let us start')
    while Guess_count < Guess_limit:
        Guess = int(input(""Guess: ""))
        Guess_count += 1
        if Guess == 10:
            print('You Win, Congratulations')
            break
        if Guess_count == 3:
            print(""You Lose"")
if Player == ""No"":
    print(' Then I Bid you Fairwell ')"

I'm currently a senior technical (14 years) writer specializing in the engineering domain. I have extensive experience utilizing tools such as Arbortext Editor, Adobe FrameMaker, and Adobe Illustrator etc to create user, maintenance, and assembly manuals for products.

Just wanted to mention another way of solving your 'List Methods' exercise.

for item in numbers:
    if numbers.count (item) != 1:
        numbers.remove (item)
print (numbers)
...................................................
I know that it is not rocket science to solve the exercises differently, but as an absolute beginner, it was extremely motivating to come up with another strategy and still get the answer right."

"If you are a windows user and you follow the installation steps described in 2024, you will encounter an error when you try to create this project. 

That is because if you install python before you install pycharm, python will not be installed in the proper location for pycharm to recognize it, then pycharm will try to install python, which it can not do, because you already have python installed. 
This error will cause you to load into a project that DOES NOT HAVE python. 
For new windows users trying to follow this, I advise that you SKIP INSTALLING PYTHON and JUST INSTALL PYCHARM. 

It will then download and install python where pycharm 'wants' it to be, saving you the time and headache that I had trying to find out where to put python so that pycharm can locate it."

"Thanks Mosh. This tutorial is wonderful. 

For those who get error after running

Error - codeset argument 

Do the following in the terminal 
1. pip uninstall django
2. pip install django // install the latest django
3. py manage.py migrate 
4. py manage.py runserver 

The error was because Mosh in his tutorial is using a older version of django and the newer version of python is looking for some argument. 
I am a novice python programmer. Above understanding of the error might be incorrect. But the steps helped me to resolve the issue."
Nice

"Hello Mr Mosh, I can not install Pycharm because it is not supported by Mac, what I have to do?"
"I can't recommend this course highly enough. As a retired software developer I've learned and used many languages from Assembly to Java since 1977.  Even though not a true ""beginner"" at programming I'm so much enjoying learning Python with you. Your easy-going, clear presentation  and well graduated course is an absolute joy.  Good to learn how to avoid pitfalls: so you *can* teach an old dog new tricks! Brilliant and fun!"

And what's more, he has risen, and is willing to call you to repentance (correction) and as his witness, by his grace indeed. ""For it is by grace you are saved, through faith"". Jesus loves you, God cares for you! Therefore, repent and believe the gospel."

"LIST METHODS PROBLEM ACTUAL SOLUTION:
Actually, what we did right there (2:13:29) is not ""removing duplicates"", but ""making a new list without duplicates"", which takes more data size (imagine a billion numbers).
So, to remove the duplicates from the list, I came up with this solution:

for item in numbers:
    if numbers.count(item) > 1:
        numbers.pop(numbers.index(item))

print(numbers)

#It eliminates all the first times the number appears, leaving the last one (second, third, seventh, millionth) in the list. The only problem is it doesn't pop the last ones, leaving the ""original"" out (imagine we care about when it happened). If anyone makes that code, please comment it. It's interesting."

"I must say, it's been one of the best learning experiences I've had. This tutorial not only provided comprehensive theoretical explanations but also made the learning process incredibly engaging through its practical exercises.What truly sets this tutorial apart is its emphasis on hands-on practice. Each concept was accompanied by relevant coding exercises, allowing me to immediately apply what I learned. This approach made it easy to follow along and solidify my understanding of the material. I appreciated that the exercises were designed to progressively build on each other, gradually enhancing my coding skills as I progressed through the tutorial."

"Title: The Al Thani Family: Guardians of Qatar's Rich Heritage and Visionaries for the Future

Introduction:
In the heart of the Arabian Peninsula, amidst the golden sands and vibrant culture of Qatar, the Al Thani family stands as a symbol of leadership, tradition, and forward-thinking vision. As a young student in Class 5 in Qatar, it's important to learn about the rich history and contributions of the Al Thani family, who have played a pivotal role in shaping the destiny of this remarkable nation.

Historical Roots:
The Al Thani family, whose lineage can be traced back to the 18th century, holds a significant place in Qatar's history. Sheikh Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani, the founder of the modern Qatari state, led the family during the tumultuous times of the 19th century. His leadership laid the groundwork for the unity and strength that Qatar enjoys today.

Leadership in the Modern Era:
As Qatar transformed into a modern and prosperous nation, the Al Thani family continued to play a crucial role in its development. His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, who assumed the throne in 1995, ushered in an era of economic growth, infrastructure development, and global engagement. Under his leadership, Qatar became known for its dynamic economy, cultural initiatives, and commitment to education and healthcare.

Humanitarian Contributions:
The Al Thani family is not only known for their leadership but also for their commitment to humanitarian causes. Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser Al Thani, the wife of Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, is a prominent advocate for education and social development. She has played a key role in advancing education initiatives in Qatar and around the world, emphasizing the importance of knowledge and innovation.

Sports and Global Recognition:
Qatar, under the guidance of the Al Thani family, has also become a global hub for sports. The successful bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup has put Qatar on the world stage and showcased its commitment to excellence in sports and infrastructure development. The family's support for sports has not only elevated Qatar's global profile but also encouraged a culture of health and fitness among the nation's residents.

Vision for the Future:
As a young student in Qatar, it is inspiring to learn about the Al Thani family's vision for the future. Qatar National Vision 2030, a comprehensive development plan, outlines the family's commitment to creating a sustainable, diversified, and knowledge-based economy. Through this vision, the Al Thanis aim to ensure a prosperous and harmonious future for the people of Qatar.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Al Thani family of Qatar stands as a beacon of leadership, tradition, and progress. As a Class 5 student in Qatar, understanding the history and contributions of this esteemed family is essential for appreciating the vibrant heritage and promising future of the nation. The Al Thanis continue to guide Qatar towards new horizons, fostering a sense of pride and admiration among its citizens, both young and old."

i = 0
while name[i] != ',':
    i += 1
    continue
print(name[0:i] + ' likes' + name[i+1:])"
How do you get condition text?
Where can i watch SQL tutorials?
"hi sir thanks alot for the video. so useful. 
my dreaming job is in Cybersecurity field!"
"Thanks for this great tutorial.
Code update : At 4 : 52 : 20 the machine learning skript (I try to run with jupyter) does not work. 
What has to be done is 
Replace 
from sklearn.externals import joblib
with
import joblib
Explanation : In scikit-learn versions 0.22 and later, the 'joblib' module was moved out of 'sklearn.externals' and into its own top-level package (ChatGPT told me)"
Code update
"in 2:24 tuple , i do this code but no problems exeption returns , what the probleme ???!!!!

it's one the best tutorial cource i've ever seen. shout out to Mosh
"I have been working on computers whether tinkering on Windows, swapping, or adding hardware, building computers for others, and really, really, really light coding. I have the Python Crash course book and have had it for quite a few years, it was given to me as a gift and I never really ever thought of being a coder and between other Hobbies (woodworking, geocaching, hiking, gardening, or learning to build anything out of any material etc... I think people term it ""A Maker"") I always come back to coding. I have watched hours of YT and gone step by step starting with attempting HTML, CSS which at the time were the easiest people said to learn. I have written programs on notepad (small ones like date and time, or a few FAKE viruses), and even made it  through and wrote a snake game, Tetris and  a few other games by following along with the person teaching and pausing the video every step of the way. The point to that long comment above is that before your videos came along, I was not able to retain anything. It was easy to follow along, but I wanted to learn because the evil in me said, ""Jus copy and paste  from GitHub and change the color or a few other lines. Which will not teach me. These have and I was able to write a riddle program sitting at my couch using pydriod on my phone and it worked. I am going to follow what you have said, ""2 hours a day, give it 90 days, see if I can truly become a code writer aka programmer. Not to gain employment per se' but to learn something else while on this earth. THANK YOU!"
"Hi Mosh , Thank you for the course !! Learnt a lot :)"
Great! Thank u.
i want to be an ai engineer
thank you sir for all python course.
Do u also conduct zoom lessons

"At 4:51:30 if you are facing any error, instead of ""from sklearn.externals import joblib"" use ""import joblib"". This is because joblib no longer comes under sklearn in the newly released versions."
"I am learning python because I have to learn the course of the the name ""Topological Data Analysis"".
Thank you so much for your videos."

"High Mosh, I am 65 and just retired last February. I was a data processing tech in the Navy worked with Cobol, and writing queries, used JCL, and did all the testing and implementation of software for what we now have as the internet. I got out of the Navy and didn't go back to working in the IT field, but now I would like to pick up Python and maybe Pandas to do freelancing remotely while traveling to supplement my retirement and social security, what would be a good avenue for this?"
I want to get into the cyber security field and  thought becoming proficient in pytrhon would help
"My question is, a code written in 5 different ways has the same outcome as functionability and etc, why should you waste your time doing the hardest one ? I understand that in different languages they force you to achieve that outcome through the hard way, but still, nowadays with ChatGPT life is easier, can anyone answer me this and start a debate on it ?  Thanks"

"1:05:03 - I modified the exercise to take user's input for the cost of house and credit score and based the calculation on their answer. I have also accommodated for user error, by implementing an error message, in the event the user enters an invalid response to the credit score question. 

cost_of_house = int(input('What is the value of the house you want to buy? £ '))
credit_score = input(""Do you have a good credit score? [yes/no] "")
credit_score = credit_score.lower() #convert user's input to lowercase

if credit_score == ""yes"":
    calculation = 0.1 * cost_of_house
    print(f""You have a good credit score. Only a 10% deposit required. 10% of {cost_of_house} = £{calculation}"")
elif credit_score == ""no"":
    calculation = 0.20 * cost_of_house
    print(f""You have a bad credit score. A 20% deposit is required. 20% of {cost_of_house} = £{calculation}"")
elif credit_score != ""yes"" and credit_score != ""no"":
    print(""Only a yes or no answer is allowed. Try again"")
print(""You're almost a homeowner"")"

You think we know everything just because we saw it once...

"ok so for the list function challenge, you said to remove the duplicates, not create a new list. This triggered me, so this was the solution I came up with. I was being picky as well and didn't want the first instance removed, only the duplicates afterwards.  had a lot of bugs figuring this out so I had it print each time it removed a number and once at the end.   This may or may not have taken me an hour :p

"Ok, problem solved, thanks to BTECH TECHNOLOGIES (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYQXFiKblLw).  When the tutorial prescribes to install Django specifying the version number by using the command ""install django==2.1"" this will cause the subsequent commands (django-admin startproject) to malfunction.  You must (as BYTECH TECHNOLOGIES suggests) omit the version number.  ""install django"" without the ""==2.1"" works fine and the subsequent commands also work.  Again, one can hardly fault Mosh for this.  In the ""olden days"" one could buy a book to learn a new language.  Now, by the time Amazon gets it to your house the syntax requirements have changed."

Dear Mosh I cannot find the summary note that you mentioned in this video. Would you please help me?
"Followed the instructions letter by letter, but so much is different. Basic commands like ""pip"" not recognized.  Can't really blame Mosh for this though; the products change so often by so many people that it seems impossible to write an accurate set of instructions.  Have reinstalled PyCharm several times, but nothing seems standardized.  I like the way he attempts to teach, but all the downloaded libraries are so different by the time you get them that enough things don't work to make it fairly futile."

I am not seeing the output of my command in the display window, what can I do ? 
it is not giving me any error message either."

How do I go about acquiring my dreamed skill with you?"
"1:19:55

Hi Mosh. There’s a flaw with using ‘else’ in your code. By using the ‘else’ statement, it implies ANY character that isn’t “L” will be assumed as the unit for kilos as opposed to the letter ‘k’ or ‘K’. 
The elif statement is applicable here."

"I am very mucy enjoying this course and am hopeful this will open upbnew opportunities for me. I started it because this seems to be one of the few ways I have of gaining a new skill within my limitations. I wasn't able to complete a degree due to financial reasons, and the several times I tried self-learning failed due to family issues. I've been doing custodial and similar unskilled labor for years. Kept trying to learn IT with ny ears while my hands were busy, but there was just too much I was missing without being to watch, and I don't have much eye time for watching. This, though, is mostly words that I can follow along and apply during my break time. Not only that, I have a hope that I can grow into a coding career rather than it being all-or-nothing, I hope to use this course to enable me to do freelance projects (again, at breaks and in short snippets at home) to build up a portfolio worthy of an actual career."

"I really love this course. In a reasonable time, one gets more than just a glimpse of Python. It really would be an appetizer for the Master Class, but honestly, 150 $ seems overpriced. I guess in the end you would have a greater effective revenue if you lowered the price to below 50 and tripled the sales. But I do like your practically oriented classes without too much theoretical burden. I wish you success with your endeavours, you really deserve it."

"00:04 Learn Python programming for building applications, websites, automation, AI, and more
06:52 In this Python tutorial, you will learn about variables and how they store data in computer memory.
20:32 Python code that asks questions and prints messages based on user input
27:16 The input function in Python always returns a string, so numerical values need to be converted to integers or floats.
40:40 Python has built-in methods to manipulate strings
47:32 In Python, strings can be manipulated using len, upper, lower, title, find, replace, and in operator
1:00:52 If statements help in executing code based on conditions.
1:07:44 Comparison operators and logical operators in Python
1:21:44 Use a while loop and conditions to ask the user to make a guess in a guessing game
1:28:16 Build a game simulation engine
1:41:44 Python for loops are used to iterate over items in a collection.
1:48:20 Nested loops can be used to generate coordinates and shapes
2:01:00 Two dimensional lists in python and list methods
2:07:36 Lists in Python have several methods to add, remove, check, sort, and copy items.
2:20:48 Accessing and updating values in a dictionary in Python
2:27:28 Break code into smaller functions for better organization and reusability.
2:40:52 Most of the time, use positional arguments. Use keyword arguments to improve code readability when dealing with numerical values. Keyword arguments should come after positional arguments.
2:47:32 By default, all functions in Python return None. You can change that by using the return statement.
3:01:08 Comments should be used to explain whys and hows, not obvious things.
3:08:00 Creating new types using classes and constructors
3:21:36 Modules help organize code and can be imported in different ways.
3:28:20 Overwriting built-in functions in Python is considered a bad practice
3:41:48 Create a class called dice with a method called row that returns a tuple of two random values.
3:48:28 You can use the glob method to search for files and directories in a given path.
4:01:20 Add a new column with corrected prices and create a chart.
4:07:52 Automation of spreadsheet updating process using python.
4:20:24 Learn how to load a csv data set in Jupiter
4:26:44 Using Jupyter shortcuts to improve coding efficiency
4:39:48 Building a model that makes accurate predictions is not always easy

Nicely explained sir
YES an easy to understand course for an easy to learn programming language
"This is great!  I really like the way you describe and deliver your course. However,  when I try  move back to review some points gets very annoying ( Not your fault Mosh), I can't go back to the place that i want. Too forward or to the back of the beginning of the lesson.

"made it to 5:45:00 Checking out from here. Was able to make it through most versioning hurdles and such, but im coming to the conclusion that this needs to be updated with new info. Being in Django 2.1 you can not finish the Orange.  Online fixes describe to move to version 2.1.5. which gets you 1 minute farther in the video, but when move to 2.1.5 the  website doesn't say why but it im no longer able to update the website program, with no error given to finish.....

ive decided to just watch the rest of the video and copy the code, sadly i wont be able to get the finished product.

ive also noticed that im not the only one with this problem, as 90% of Traffic drops off at 5:45:00

Mosh your a great  teacher and i wish you had more updated work, i will not be buying your course because i dont think it has been updated. similarly to this video."

"This is awesome! At 33 I've decided its time for a career change and will be getting my masters in data analytics and Python is widely used in the program I will be starting in March, I'm almost 2 hours into this video in 2 nights and loving it! Tonight was a little more fast paced and confusing for my liking, but its midnight and thats probably why. I'll likely go back and redo the video again once I complete it to see if I can do all the tests in one try, I usually have to wait to see you do them before it makes sense. But thanks for making it so easy to understand! I used C++ for a financial engineering/programming course in my undergrad but that was over 11 years ago. Excited to dive more into this course and learn as much as I can. Maybe I'll do the 1 hour course as well after then back to this one.

You're amazing!"
Your videos are both informative and enjoyable. Keep it up!

    count = int(list.count(number))
    if count > 1:
        list.remove(number)

PS.: I know that every excercise can be done somehow and there is no wrong answer if it is working. Also I do not have any experience with python or programming in general... All I wanted was to share a different solution I came up with, that is all. 
I also wanted to thank you for sharink this wonderful tutorial. Sometimes it was hard but it really helped me with my programming. I am a person who was studying law in my hagh school and did my final exams from contracts, paragraph, psychology etc. But for me maths and IT really influenced me a lot so I went and started to study those things. At the university I was like hell... Everyone already knew everything (or knows bcs the school started for me just a month ago) and I was awefully behind. Thanks to you it is now bareble. THANK YOU, I owe you big time."

This tutorial not only provided comprehensive theoretical explanations but also made the learning process incredibly engaging through its practical exercises.What truly sets this tutorial apart is its emphasis on hands-on practice. Each concept was accompanied by relevant coding exercises, allowing me to immediately apply what I learned. This approach made it easy to follow along and solidify my understanding of the material. I appreciated that the exercises were designed to progressively build on each other, gradually enhancing my coding skills as I progressed through the tutorial.very good i really apprciate you"

I haven`t understood yet why duplicates in machine learning is a bad practice/ 
Also, if we get better results the more data we give to our model why don`t we just split it 90 percent to training, and 10 percent to testing? Isn`t it because our accuracy score won`t be so accurate with only 10 percent?"

I’m a navy vet, we have very straight forward plain language explanations for SOP’s so it’s been very good to have that for learning a computer language."
"I see a distinction in that you don't refer to lists as arrays in Python as a list can be a multi type list of things where an array is typically a single type structure.   Interestingly....
list = (1, ""Bob"", True, 4.4)
print(list.count(1))
print(list.count(True))

both return 2 instead of intuitive 1, I guess because as in other languages, 0 is considered False and 1 is considered True.  Can you tell I am a QA engineer by trade ?  :)"

"Your tutorial on has good credit and no criminal record is wrong lol

You said “they should have good credit and no criminal record”
and then set
has_criminal_record = True
and then you used 
if has_good_credit and (not) has_criminal_record:
print(“Eligible for loan”)

(Not) is uno reverse card xd

So you end up saying if they have good credit and criminal record then they are eligible
doesn’t make sense to your objective

"You know what? If it's not one bloody issue it's another. 

Why do I keep getting the sodding ERROR404 message whenever I go to the development server page?

Why does this thing have to be so bloody stupid all the time? Why can't something just do as it's told? Absolute retardness at it's finest.

This has quite frankly got to be the most stupid, idiotic system I have ever come across, nothing bloody works, the web server doesn't work, there ae constant error messages despite me doing everything correctly. Works perfectly the first time, this it decides its going to be a disobedient little shit. I swear to God if I see that 404 screen one more time I am going to go absolutely ballistic. 

I am so angry right now I could scream. Why do I always get this?! Why whenever I do something it never bloody works! I am absolutely fuming at this thing right now, I am so close to taking this computer and throwing it against the wall.

"Just so you can read my story. 
The story of Themightymiracleman: living with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
It started on the night of October 14, 2011. Never in my wildest dreams did I think this would happen... I had just awoken from a nap and was really to set out to meet my father and brother for a weekend hunting trip. Unfortunately, that weekend would be the start of a different kind of journey, a very long and arduous one. I had just made it through Montana and was on the Lolo pass along the river, which was on my left when it happened. I was driving along when suddenly a deer jumped in front of me. I swerved left. Bad idea, the river was there, so I turned right quickly and over corrected accidently. The car flipped on it’s side and slid into the hillside. When it did my head slammed into the seat and then rebounded into the steering wheel. This is when I lost consciousness.

I’ve been told that several hours passed before a truck driver discovered my car, who unhitched his load to hurry to an emergency phone line. Since it was foggy they couldn’t send an airplane or helicopter and I had to wait several hours for an ambulance out of Missoula, Montana. I hung upside down by the seatbelt for hours with a broken Sternum, both clavicles, six ribs, two vertebrae, and a collapsed lung. I imagine most of the readers are going, “that’s quite a bit of broken bones, how is he not dead?” Honestly I’m thinking the same thing as I write this. I have a very deep faith so I hope you’ll understand my belief that God must have saved me.


My physical therapist's assistant, Shawn Burke who's also a personal trainer and ASEA athlete, invited me to a meeting for something called ASEA. I didn't know what it was at the time but I and my chemical engineer dad soon learned how Asea boosts our own natural redox signaling. My dad being a chemical engineer and me being a pre-med student, understood the chemistry behind the product. . As I listened about the chemistry, I started to point at a bottle and whisper to my dad that I needed it. After the meeting, we went up and asked about getting on the product. I was disappointed at first to find out that we had to order and wait for it. That disappointment soon changed though as they figured out how to get me some that night, I started the product that night, and I've been on it ever since
Life changing-

As I said, I got the product that night and started it. I notced that I felt better after the first two weeks  but was skeptical if it  was because of ASEA. As you can see, I was wheelchair bound at the time when I got on the product. After around 4-5 weeks, I was able to start walking with the use of a walker. I progressed to forearm crutches after a couple months and then to a single forearm crutch a few weeks later. After a few weeks with that, I went to a single point cane  I relied heavily on the cane for several weeks but after that, I began to rely less and less on it. I used the cane sparingly for only about a month before I was able to walk on my own. For the next year, I carried a walking stick just in case but hardly ever had to use it, After a year, I felt safe enough to put the walking stick away. 

What I only came to know much much later was that I had hung unconscious upside down in my smashed jeep for hours. I hung upside down by the seatbeltFor hours until someone found me. 
During my 4 months in a coma the doctors told my parents the hardest thing that any doctor could ever have to say, the doctor thought the kindest thing to do would be to turn off the machines and euthanize me to go in peace. In his opinion the rest of my life consisted of a vegetative state, constant care, and a long oblivion of isolation and silence.

My parents refused to accept this death sentence for their child. 

Instead they chose the impossible task of caring for me themselves. They decided they would take me home and do whatever they had to do for me to have any quality of life. To do anything they could to help me. 

My parents put me up in their own room to take of the special needs I had such as toileting at night. They worked with me and cared for me and never gave up on me. They had to start over, teaching me everything again. It was about at this time when my dad, who has a degree in chemical engineering was approached by a physical therapist assistant from another hospital who wanted to introduce us to a technology he felt would help my condition. His name was Shawn Burke and the technology was ReDox Signaling Molecules.

My dad understood the significance of this science and its implications right away. I understood too what this represented.  So I started taking the ReDox multiple times a day.  I also started seeing Shawn who tirelessly worked with me. Shawn was actually with me for my first steps that were totally assisted, and was still working with me to see me take my first steps unassisted. I have no doubt that my recovery was due to not only my own will, and Shawn's hard work and encouragement, but it was in large part the ReDox technology that helped me battle my way through insurmountable odds. 

After having my parents told to euthanize me, and my being told time after time by doctors that I had little to no chance of any quality of life, and would certainly never walk, run, or do anything approaching a physical endeavor, it all sounded pretty hopeless.  My parents, and Shawn told me not to listen. I was the master of my future. To set goals. So I did. I wanted to stand strong. With these people behind me and this amazing technology I proved everyone else wrong. Thanks to ReDox technology, my parents and so many special people, like Shawn Burke who never gave up on me, I am now doing all of those things they said I never could, and more. 

I have gone from life support, to a wheel chair, to a walker, then with the aid of two walking sticks, then, finally walking free of any aid. Now I am riding a bike and sprinting. I am also learning to once again, drive a car.

Looking towards the future, my goal is to do a triathlon. When I do, no doubt Shawn Burke, Champion Ironman, regardless of my pace, will never leave my side. He is now a close friend.

I battled my way back to the living thanks to ReDox Signaling Molecules. I am now in Physical Therapy School, and my goal is to reach out to as many people as I can to encourage them, and their families to never give up hope. I'll do this through my life's experience, as a physical therapist and trainer like Shawn. With determination, hope, and a little help from ReDox technology, which has helped my body heal, I am living proof of what can be accomplished. So don't give up. Stand up. No matter how long it takes.

Appreciate your work btw. Thank you."
How do you create the condition text😢
I have soo fear how to learnt python actually I don't no basics in python but see this video I have hope I can learnt the python 🎉
"For those who are requesting for the cheat sheet, here it is:

"Thanks, Mosh! I've been learning through you, a couple others on YouTube, and a handful of books. I studied stats and SPSS in grad school about 12 years ago and because my MA is in biological anthropology, I'm planning on taking this next level to study captive wildlife in zoos. Python and R will be helping me out a lot. What do you think? Zoos are a huge resource for analysis and the well-being of animals. Thanks again!"
I am watching this video in 2023 AI supremacy is here and i am a housewife and a mother of a toddler i want to do a job from home thats why i am learning python but before this video i was confused about python now i am enjoying learning it thankyou soooooooo much mosh you are a gem i am from future😂😅😅😅
"Two years ago I felt REALLY lost in life.
I had worked as a tour guide, cook, waiter, salesman, etc... and didn't have any higher education (I had really good grades but I started working really early in life and moved a lot) nor any idea what I'd do with my life.
I was planning on studying tourism or hotel-related stuff but it was like yeah, I guess I can do that, I wasn't too excited about it.
Then one day, while taking a preparation course to work as a tourist entertainer in Ibiza, I randomly found this exact video, and it caught my attention for some reason, even if it was 6 hours long.
I started watching, I started installing stuff and following the instructions, started having fun and actually loving it, started playing around, making silly stuff on my own, staying up all night, making a rock, paper, scissors based on nested if's @ 7am...
Until I got to the pandas part where I got bored and closed the video (this was maybe 1 or 2 days after finding the video and playing around with python).
A few hours passed and I opened the editor again and started doing stuff, the next day the same, and again and again, until one day... this might sound REALLY random but I thought, let's try and learn html, css & js to make websites, so I went to freecodecamp.org and started doing the course.
Few hours or days pass, I can't tell because I really lost track of time, I get to the projects part, I FAIL TERRIBLY at making the simplest of all until I realised I was doing this wrong, I don't have to memorize everything like at school!! people actually GOOGLE to do stuff, so I started googling how to do this, how to do that and finally managed to get some things done.
Kept studying for a few months (freecodecamp, youtube, the odin project, fullstackopen), felt lost again because I didn't know how to improve until I started doing personal projects aaaaaand fast forward a few months from that point - I found a nice job full remote at an amazing company with really good values and coworkers and couldn't be happier.
I'm still working at the same company and trying my hand in freelancing, blogging, still learning... 
This was quite a journey for me :) sorry for the long comment I guess! But I hope someone finds it funny, helpful or even motivating :D and thank you so much Mosh for this amazing course, it gives me so many good memories/flashbacks/nostalgia."
.
The PyCharm code editor has no more free option. Is there any other free version of a code editor?
2019 ???? holy
Why is there no subtitle for my last project here? Are you guys too? who can reply me

My name is Mahmud Adegboyega, am one of your online students from Nigeria, I am also aspiring to become a Software Engineer like you.
I watched your six hours python course and u mentioned in it that we should dedicate at least two hours to practicing python codes, but my question Sir is that how long do u recommend for watching new tutorials and how long for practicing and what can we practice .

"Oh wow, disappointing to hear you hate cats. You seemed like a nice guy but i guess you still let people convince you that cats were bad. Hating cats is not a valid or morally okay thing to do. Its like hating babies bc they take responsibility to care for. Thats a you problem. Babies cant help needing to be taken care of. Just like any reason you hate cats is also a you problem. Theyre annoying?? How? Bc you need to get their consent before theyll let you pet them? And theyll lash out if you try doing it anyway? Thats exactly how a person should be reacting to you too, but its wrong for cats to do it bc you expect them to please you by them letting you feel them as much as you want, and not be their own creatures? 

They dont show you love and keep to themselves? Only if you dont show them love, bc cats reciprocate what you give and if all you give is annoyance and hate instead of understanding them, they are fully within their rights to not like you. Any caring cat owner knows the signs of a cat who cares back. My own cat barely leaves my side bc she's following me 24/7 and loves to have my attention and pets/rubs bc I gained her trust first.

They push things off tables and shelves and make noise at night? Guess what? Theyre animals. It's their nature to be curious (they push things bc thats their way of examining them, even if theyve done it a million times before) and energetic at night bc thats when their hunting would happen if they werent a house cat. But dogs can bark like crazy or make a MUCH bigger mess without being hated bc people excuse it for them being lovable but dogs literally dont have a choice but to love you bc they evolved from wolves with Williams syndrome that makes them happy all the time. 

Cats are not dogs. Stop comparing them as if cats should be obedient and mindlessly happy for you. Dogs unfortunately have a problem and are just being taken advantage of by humans who dont care to do any actual bonding with their animals and just want to go straight into getting love, which makes it so much easier to abuse them if they already trust you. But cats? Too many people go out of their way to harm them bc they WONT let them do as they please with them. Kind of like with women by men. Which is why hating cats is typically a sign of you also being mysogynistic at least a little bit, since ultimately a hate for cats comes from not understanding consent and those men dont like getting consent from women either. But if you hate them bc 'theyre annoying' its bc youre putting unfair expectations on them, like expecting them to not be animals... when theyre animals, especially if you dont hate dogs bc dogs act like animals way more than cats do (they sleep 20 hours a day, they literally dont have the time to annoy you as much as dogs can)  but your hate somehow only applies to cats?

If you actually gave cats a chance by treating them as the independent creatures that they are and werent a terrible person you will find that they are wonderful, arguably more so than dogs, bc when they give you their consent they are happy with you by choice, not bc theyre made to believe you can be trusted by a mental disorder.

I hope your opinion of cats change."
Can i learn a python iam new and i have no knowledge about it. Can i become a developer.. reply plz
"Thanks Mosh, may GOD bless you for your free videos especially this one. Thanks so much sir"

"1:59:45 Find largest number in list.
Okay, I had fun with this one. I learned how to use a ternary operator to find which number is larger.
(spoiler below)
... 


But then I thought, there's got to be an easier way!
So, I thought about function chaining, and tried num_list.sort()[-1]. 
But this is invalid because num_list is not immutable, so the sort() function changes num_list.
so, my code was:
num_list = [3,6,8,3,5,4]
num_list.sort()
print(f""Largest number is {num_list[-1]}"")

For those interested in the ternary solution: 
for num in num_list: 
    largest = num if largest < num else largest"

"My solution for the Weight Converter excercise:

weight = input('Please enter your weight: ')
lbs_kg = input('(L)bs or (K)g: ')

l = float(weight) * 0.45
k = float(weight) / 0.45

"Honestly i have no interest in programming or anything about computers, and for me i am just exploring it since i don't really have an interest in anything and then i discovered programming and think why not give it a try. And as i explore this subject i kinda gain an interest on studying programming. I seen lot of people that inspired me to this subject and right now i am a completely beginner and i have no idea about programming. This video is actually nice because i spent lots of my time trying to learn progamming on the internet and i don't really undestand anything, i am completely lost.

"for the removing duplicates exercise
This is the code i used because i thought i could only use one list may be helpful if for some reason it would be hard to integrate a new list
prices = [10, 5, 8, 45, 7, 2, 5, 91, 85, 1, 65, 10, 5, 8, 45, 7, 2, 5, 91, 85, 1, 65]

print(prices)
[10, 5, 8, 45, 7, 2, 5, 91, 85, 1, 65]
started with a while loop but that was causing there to still be 2 of 85 not sure why but changing it fix it right away"

"Hi Mosh! Thank you for this wonderful tutorial! I am enjoying it a lot. My background is that of a philosopher and I have one question for now :)) 
Namely, on 26:44 you put the converting funciton in the second line. I've put it into the first line like this  birth_year = int(input(""Birth year: "")) So I suppose that is not a mistake? When I run the program first time and got the error message, I made some changes, I deduced that I need to convert a value so Python could read it. I did it on the first line instead of a second. (I practiced some Python several months ago, but it seems I remember something from that time. 
Thank you once more Mosh! :))"

Can someone help me?"
"i know it's pretty late but since i see people still commenting on this video i was hoping to get some help with the second project he's providing (machine learning with python).
I'm currently at 4:51:20 and the output i'm given is of import error regarding line 3.
It says 'ImportError: cannot import name 'joblib' from 'sklearn.externals' (C:\Users\<username>\anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\sklearn\externals\__init__.py)'

I've double-checked the spelling on the the name, as well as double checked the location but both seem to be where they should be. If i try to open externals in the code editor on Pycharm however then the file seems to be empty.
I've googled the problem, but it gives very advanced solutions. Since i'm still in the beginners area, i assume the problem could be resolved in an easier way than the answers i've recieved.
I also tried to re-download the music.csv file but it still gives me the same error.

(I have only followed every step of this tutorial)
Appreciating any help"
I can't see my name 😮
"Great Course!
I am learning python because it is really interesting and i also want to start a good career
Im just 12 so i dont need to pay bills and can learn python peacefully"
"Mosh, thank you so much for your this amazing tutorial! You are very clear and informative. Sometimes you make these side comments. For example in 2:21:51, “when you use the .get() method, the program isnt going to yell at you when the key does not exist.” That just made my day!"
Respected I from india i am new to computer science and I have no idea about anything related to computer I have no idea about my dream just learning python as a starter then i will decided what i am gonna do in the future (while writing this comment i didn't watch video)(sorry for my english I just you know starting learning english too )
Hey Mosh I tried to get the cheat sheet and it says the page isn't found? do you have another link?

Can we get part two of this course that continues this course
"Just in case other viewers encounter issues. Hope this helps!
1.	Jupyter acting weird and not like PyCharm: not showing me all the files on my computer, not completing parintheses or quotations like in PyCharm, and lots of other things.
From my Windows Starter area, Open Jupyter Notebook
2.	Jupyter is not able to find a file I call on (if Jupyter not opened as mentioned above).
Move the file I’m searching for into the same folder that shows up on my “files” page in the Home tab of Jupyter: figure out where I store the file on my laptop, and then drag and drop it into the correct folder within the file explorer of my laptop.
3.	Unable to install pip, or pip is not recognized by Python.
Go to Python installer > Modify > check the box for pip > Modify. Then reinstall Python.
4.	Jupyter does not find/recognize/use pandas
Go to PyCharm > terminal > pip install pandas
5.	“ModuleNotFoundError” for sklearn.tree. Jupyter does not find/recognize/use sklearn.
Open Jupyter Notebook the correct way (see above) > 
!pip install scikit-learn
If the error looks like it’s actually related to another library, you may need to run this instead if installing scikit-learn doesn’t fix the issue.
!pip install daal4py
6.	How to import joblib. (Receiving message like “Cannot import joblib from sklearn.externals”)
Instead of writing “from sklearn.externals import joblib”, just write “import joblib”."

i am seeing this course now its been 4 yrs ago. can i still learn from these videos or it has changed some how please guide me i am new in programming
"Idk why i’m learning python tbh. I’d like to work as a programmer but idk what specific field.

    duplicate = number_list[0]
    if duplicate == items:

symbol = 'x'
for items in list:

"Hello. Just trying to see if someone could help. When you have a python project setup in the IDE, does the order of code, need to go from top to bottom? Do you need to have the imported libraries (If any) at the beginning? Some projects have things organized in different folders in the IDE. How do I set that up to run correctly?

 I don't know if that's something more advanced you learn later on or not. (Hopefully this all makes sense). If anyone knows of a book that can explain those things, please let me know."

Thanks for your course! You have pedagogical skills!
You have a bug on the weight converter. If you enter any other letter than L, the code will assume is K. It needs a ""while"" or something else. 
How I wrote the code:

while True:
    weight = int(input('Weight: '))
    unit = input('(L)bs or (K)g: ')

    if unit.upper() == 'L':
        converted = weight * 0.45
        print(f'You are {converted} kilos')
        break
    elif unit.upper() == 'K':
        converted = weight / 0.45
        print(f'You are {converted} pounds')
        break
    else:
        print('You need to choose (L)bs or (K)g. Please try again.')

This way, goes back on asking you for L or K.

Thank you!"

It's like my 5th day of learning python, on and off. Anyways this is my solution, I also recycled some part of the rock, paper, scissors projects in beginner for python in freecodecamp video too, I wanted a response type thing so I made this, here it is:

price = 1000000
price_10 = 1000000 * .10
price_20 = 1000000 * .20

    print(f""If you wish to purchase the house you would need to put a downpayment of: ${int(price_10)} USD."")

else: 
    print(""Welcome! You are an eligible buyer."")
    print(f""If you wish to purchase the house you would need to put a downpayment of: ${int(price_20)} USD."")

"This course is helping me through my college Python course, thank you much ! I’m currently at the Building the Car exercise 1:41:42 and I’m struggling to make sense of the additional ‘if statements’ that were added for the ‘started’ Boolean expressions. 

 I understand this: If ‘started = False’ means the car isn’t started and ‘if started:’ means the car is already started so the “Car is already started!” is printed.
What I don’t understand is this: “else: started=True print(“car started…”)… How is this correct if “started=False” means the car isn’t started; wouldn’t that in turn mean if “started=True” then the car is already started??? What is the difference btw “if started:” and “else: started=True” , are those statements not implying the same exact thing: that the car is already started???"

print (""thank you"") * 1000000 . 

So as to your question: Why do you want to learn python? Well the answer to this is I want to get into AI engineering. As I have been observing the whole world is freaking out about AI right now. People are worried about the job market and how AI is going to impact traditional jobs. Well my solution to this is, if you cannot beat them, join them. So I want to get into AI 1. because this is interesting to me. 2. because I would like to create an alexa type program that can better meet my unique needs. I would also like to do something with education or engineering. I have had a few carreers one building funiture and then teaching. This will be my third career.

"I have been going through this course and I believe some aspects of it are a little outdated. 

For example during the Machine Learning Project there is a command that you have to input ""from sklearn.externals import joblib"" however when the code is run I receive the following output ""ImportError: cannot import name 'joblib' from 'sklearn.externals'"". 

There are a couple of other issues that I have been running into during this specific project none of which have impeded the project itself so far like this one. I triple check spelling and capitalization to ensure I am typing everything exactly as I see it in the guide. 

With that said this course is amazing and informative but for those finding it and watching it four years later like I am just keep in mind that it isn't an end all be all and there are problems with the course that may have not existed 4 years ago."

Thanks again!"
"My solution to this challenge 01:52:52 was this:
___
longer = ""xxxxx""
shorter = ""xx""
for x in range (2):
    print (longer)
    for y in range (0, x+1):
        print (shorter)

You can replace the last line of my code with this line below, to see what's happening in each run off the loops:

"I'm a retired math teacher and you can guess my age when I say I used to do a lot of programming in BASIC, and Fortran before that.  I have no need to improve my employability and simply want to learn Python for fun.  The first 3.5 hours of this video were great and have given me a good starting point.  After that it was like drinking water from a fire hose, and on topics, like manipulating Excel spreadsheets, that I have little interest in.  I might come back to that stuff later but I need to do a lot more basic skill building first.  Thank you for all of the time and effort that you have put into this."

"I have a slight issue. I watched the ""Learn Python in an hour"" video and I understand all of it (Going over those parts again here to solidify it into my mind some more) I had ""if statements"" down fine when doing the last video but in this one my code doesn't work unless I make something ""=="" and not ""="" like the video shows. this is the code that I got working for the credit check part of this course: 

good_credit = True
good_income = True


if good_credit and good_income == True:
    print(""Here, have some money."")
else:
    print(""Nope."")

Like I say if I make it  ""if good_credit and good_income = True:"" it doesn't work. How it is above works, however it says that there is a weakness in my code. Can someone please explain why this is?

The difference between a programming language and problem-solving with computers is the difference between English grammar and creative programming.
I was exceptionally lucky in having Alan J. Perlis as my first professor. He taught us about programming, not about programming languages.
I was also exposed to Assembly Language, Algol, Lisp, APL, Fortran, and Cobol.
My most toxic program was written in Fortran and Assembly Language. I submitted my punched cards. The next day, I got my deck, output, and a note from the operator. My program had crashed the mainframe 5 times. The output showed that it was never even executed. It caused the linkage editor to crash the system.

P.S. Python, although popular, is just a hacked-up dialect of C trying to pass as Object-Oriented programming and Functional programming."
thank you so much!! I actually feel like im learning to code!

"Hi, my story i want to become a digital nomad. 
I'd like to travel and still earn. I an retired and I'm soon to be 63 yrs new.
I took a few classes back in the 80s IBM and IBM through Advanced. 
I enjoy learning how to code back then but not having a college degree made it difficult to get a job in this field back then. But with technology moving so fast and the internet being available to teach you just about anything. 
I want to try again at coding.  I'm still not sure what I want to do as I'm just learning whats what.
But I do know what ever I dont I want to do it from where ever I'm living at that time. I dont know what career I'm interested in but I've always loved computers and search a lot I like to learn about stuff. Can you help me figure out what I want to do. Lol
I dont want to be a hacker the good kind. Thats too much to learn at my age but I was thinking cloud computing maybe or Dev oops block chain or cyber security.  All pay well and I think all can be done remotely. I an trying to get a good foundation so I'm learning A+ and I between python with you. And of course I want to get certified for each lesson i completed. 
So I understand A+ is and python are two respected certifications 
And both will help me to excel. But Its still to early to plan a career. This is not a problem right now because learning is more important right now and the 2 basics A+ and python are essential to what ever i choose to do.
But any insight ypu can give me or even advise me to another career that can earn me a living as a digital nomad I would love to hear your input. And the 2 courses I'm interested in learning 
Are they what you would recommend? I know the corse I'm learning you made 4 yrs ago and you might not even see this in the comments but thays ok just hoping your still here. But thanks for the free course its much appreciated and I can learn from you.  Which is a compliment because I dont learn easily from just anyone. 😂"

"Whoa, check out this epic tutorial on Python! The dude teaching it really knows his stuff and breaks down all the tricky bits into easy-to-follow steps. And get this, the tutorial is over 6 hours long and covers everything from the basics to advanced stuff!

I've been on the hunt for a sick Python tutorial for ages, and this one totally blew me away. The explanations are super clear, the examples are dope, and there are even interactive exercises to help you practice.

I'm so stoked to start using my new Python skills thanks to this tutorial. If you're looking to learn or up your Python game, this is the tutorial for you!

ps. this comment is composed by chatGPT, however i really appreciate you for this USEFUL tutorial !!!"
Really appreciate those kind words at the beginning for us first-timers.
"BEWARE - Mosh is a scam - I bought his Mastering React course. The course told me to download a specific version of Node JS and React which is no longer supported. I therefore could not follow his videos at all. I sent a support note asking him to either update the course so that the technology is not out of date or refund my money. He didn't even have the decency to even respond to my request. Basically, he stole almost $200 of my money. I instead enrolled in a similar course on Udemy which was up-to-date and a great course. After this experience, I read a bunch of other reviews of this course and they all said the same thing. Please do not waste your money on any of Mosh's courses."

Kindly let me know this will lay a foundation for me to connect Python with Big Data ? 

Thanks!!!"
"I just started with this course and I really love the way Mosh smiles and teaches python like it's abc. I love the way he goes ahead into knowing what you'd be confused about and guides you. The intermittent assignments are lovely because it makes you put yourself out there already, even with the little that has been taught...so you know you're already capable of writing your own programs.
Great work here, Mosh❤"

"wait a minute!!  you can just arbitrarily add a new parameter to an object?  So if I misspell something like square.x_upper_left_croner = 10 it would just take this as a new parameter?  That seems so dangerous.
[Edit]: Is there a way to turn that off?  To make it only declared functions & parameters are allowed?  Or some other safeguard?"

"Good afternoon.
Please tell me: and really using Python create an information system ""Electronic Archive of Documents"" (document management) and how much time can it take if I am a beginner?

Approximate system structure:
 
Block No. 0. The form of entering the login and password (users access to the system will be carried out through the Chrome browser). Those. The user of the system comes under his account. And in the future, all his actions in this system are displayed in the journal with the date. The magazine is available only for Admin.

Block No. 1. Hidden section: This section will be available only for the system administrators (Login- Admin) and this section is not visible to ordinary users. In this section, you can enter information about users, add new sections, adjust existing sections.

Block No. 2. Transfer of documents: There are a lot of paper documents that enter the archiving department from other divisions of the company. These documents are registered in a special form, scanned and transferred to the archival room for storage. In this case, the scan-copy of the documents is attached to the card of a registered document in the database of this system;

Block No. 3. Issues of documents for temporary use: paper documents are issued for temporary use to employees of the company's units with the corresponding entry in the database (name, document number, document status, e-mail, office, date of issue and return, etc.);

Block No. 4. Document write -offs: is carried out by the archiving department together with the unit that initiated the process of writing off documents. Also, the whole process is recorded in the database (name, document number, e-mail, office No., the discharge date, signatures of the parties).

Note:
- in blocks 1-4 there is a “search” field, which makes it possible to quickly find here or other information in the database;
- Fast import / export of data from Excel should also be configured;
- must be attached by scan-copies of documents;
- Many users of the company will have access to this base, but only to the corresponding sections (blocks) of the database that they themselves can fill out."

"Moshe - Tremendous thank you to your video. To answer your question, I want to be able to automate clinical chart language to be processed into excel sheets. Currently SQL data abstraction is used to do this manually for the research of interest by human but I can capture this using this automation. I also want to automate the cell types and gene programming change when I have sequenced samples in same format. Tremendous amount of manual curations happen during this process but building the pipeline can let many of these steps automated. Still manual curation will be required but I see python can save ton of time and labor for this type of research. Machine learning is helping some aspect of this but I'm thrilled to see how much potential this tool has and your tutorial has been amazing and I want to thank you! Amazing work here."

Anyway, I just wanted to remind you in 1:20:00 weight converter program you should add an elif function instead of else for 'K' after the if function for 'L'. Otherwise, if the user were to type in any other letter than 'K', the program will still convert the weight to lbs despite the wrong letter input. The else function should be used for when the user input letters other than 'L' or 'K' and resulted in a ""Wrong Data Input"" or something. In any case, thanks once again. Keep up the good work!"

but in line 6, the condition says 'if started' that implies the 'started' value has 'True' boolean value. Did someone noticed it also?"

"Hey, Mosh. I got here from watching and writing notes on your 1 hour beginners course, and am now watching your full Python course. I am a university student studying a double Bachelor's degree in Science (Biomedical and Genetics) and Engineering (Robotics and A.I.), so I need to learn Python really quickly for both genetic programming and robotics and A.I. development and machine learning. I found your 1 hour course quite helpful with referencing the basic principles of computing languages, and the key terms of how to use in in practice. I am just at the start of this course now, so I am hoping that it will teach me quite a bit more regarding the language and how to apply it to my studies.

Kind regards,
Reece."

I have never touched one until college. I majored in Mathematics in the undergrad and Computer Science (programming course, only C++ was taught) was my most dreaded subject. Sure enough, I got the lowest possible passing grade at the end of the sem. That was the only computer course in the BS Math curriculum. Fast forward to today, I have little to beginner knowledge about programming and as a statistics instructor I think it's very important that I learn this skill."

What changed everything to me was learning through basic programming logic books. You need to walk before you can run. 
Once I got the basics right, learning Python and everything else became much easier.
Edit: For those asking about the books, the best basic one is Javascript In Less than 50 Pages.
It`s about Javascript but it is the fastest to learn the conceps that will be useful in any programming language. 
Then I would definetly recommend A Smarter Way to Learn Python. Your knowledge will transform."

I wasn't able to launch my website and just kept getting error-messages. Took me a few hours of research to see that I needed to delete that 2.1 Django version as it was preventing me from working on the project, and then install the newest version. Once I did that (and followed this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XYsODaQ6Ok for the first 8 minutes) it was finally successful.

Hi please when I run my code I get “Hi pycharm” as the result
Please how do you download using p.c
"I haven't come across any teacher as good as you at clarification since I started studying programming... Thanks for the great work Mosh.
But at 3:54:20 I couldn't continue with you because, the command ""pip install openpyxl"" brought an error in the pycharm terminal ("" pip is not recognised as an internal or external command""), what could be the problem, please help me because the rest of the tutorials from that point rely on that terminal but Ive been recieving the same error.

PLEASE HELP:"

"Good day Mosh, 

I work in investment management and am looking to find ways to automate some routine tasks, such as pull in excel sheets, extract data and display in a clear way. In addition, also be able to dump a large amount of data about a company, eg total sales, sales of different products, cost etc and present it in a way to tell a story. Is Python appropriate or should I look at other programmes, perhaps SQL. I have watched the 1 hour intro and found it very interesting, thanks for the great content."

Why do you put the greater than symbol in?

"Really great course! I've encountered a huge problem tho. When I've installed openpyxl and later try to import it to the first automation project, pycharm is not able to find openpyxl, and just returns an error saying ""No module named 'openpyxl' "". I have successfully uninstalled + reinstalled it with the ""pip install openpyxl"" yet I keep getting the error message, meaning I can't participate in the project that I was really looking forward to. I've also tried googling the answer without luck. Help anyone?

EDIT: I managed to find a solution after banging my head against the wall for an hour, trying to locate the file on my pc. I'll keep my comment in case anyone else needs it. What I did first of all was to restart PyCharm (not sure if necessary), after that double press SHIFT to have a kind of searchbar open up in PyC. Then type in openpyxl, and in my case it couldn't find the file on my computer (I don't know why) but it suggested to install it for me then and there. I pressed ""install"" and about 1 minute later got a notification from PyCharm saying that it was successfully installed. I was then able to find workbook and run my code."

Can anyone explain to me why my ""solution"" for the exercise in the minute 1:17:27 doesn't work?
I understand that this way is not the most efficient but I would like to understand why mine doesn't work.

My solution:

weight = input(""Weight: "")
type_of_weight = input(""(L)bs or (K)g: "")

if type_of_weight == ""L"" or ""l"":

    print(f""You are {float(weight) * 0.45} Kg"")

elif type_of_weight == ""K"" or ""k"":

    print(f""You are {float(weight) * 2.2} Lbs"")

else:

    print(""Invalid input, try again."")


I was able to identify that what's not working properly is the ""L"" or ""l"" but I just don't know why"
Hi my name is Manha and i am 9 years old i love computers and programming so i am here to learn something new from you. heard about Python and you so i am here to learn a new language with you in a easy way. just watched few videos of you so i am already interested the way you taught us here on youtube. keep up the good work
"Just started a week ago and i have been doing 30min every day and im currently at 4:04:41 and damn is it fun, the explaining is clear and i have been taking notes too thx for this :)    edit: im now close to finishing...i was doing a side project on python .:) i can finally do some things and make some apps ive been wanting, with googles help ofc"
I enrolled in your courses - well worth it. nicely presented and easy to follow. Mainly for my 11 yo daughter - a great coding start !
"Hi Mosh, I am struggling with importing the openpyxl package I use a Windows machine and my pip openpyxl install was set to a folder diffeent to how you described it in the video. Mine downloaded to External Libraries-Python3.11-Python311-Lib-site packages. Do I move it manually? and if so, to where? Please advise."
"hi
bro"
"Jesus loves you and so he laid down his life as payment for your sins for  death is the just payment for sin. For God, more important than the forgiveness of sins He wanted to change our twisted perverted nature by making us his children. John 3:16 &17. Romans 10:9&10. God doesn’t want anyone to perish or go to hell. He wants us all to be saved but He is a just God, he can’t let a sinner go unpunished but you can’t live in sin and dwell in God’s presence. Light and darkness can not exist together. Embrace the sacrifice of Christ which is for the forgiveness of sins and the birth of a new nature on the inside of you if you believe. Believe in the God’s son Jesus Christ. God bless you.🙏🏾"

I'm a medical resident trying to learning Phyton for my thesis. This course has really helped me understand the basic of phyton. Thank you!
It's amazing how a problem have a lot of different approach to its solution, for example in the list method exercise on how to remove duplicates, my solution is totally different from Mosh's solution, but still produce same results. That's the beauty of coding! 

for item in numbers:
    while numbers.count(item) > 1:
        numbers.remove(item)
print(numbers)"
"Never done anything in coding before, never studied in depth. Learning how to use python to help my family with a start up AI company not a job lol."

For example, for his ""find the max number"" problem(2:01:50) I wrote a code that is only 3 lines long, and when I run it I get the same result. Is this acceptable or do I need to learn to do it the way Mosh is?"

Me, after trying to make the code work for 20 Minuten, crying, ghasping for air after coming to terms with my lack of talent and looking at the solution: Yeah ;) It's actually really simple....

I just wanted to add, that I'm an absolute beginner. I'm 19 and needed to quit my prior job because of an injury and I always wanted to learn how to code. I always wanted to start a tech carrier, but was way too scared that my ADHD would make it impossible. So I decided to prove myself wrong.

I just need to post this for myself. As promise/reminder or just for ventilation.

 It's new year. I am at worst ever so far in my life and i feel like i did nothing. For last months I said everyone I am learning coding for job (tried university and i wasn't for me but i would like to try again at begining of new semestr). My effort for anything related for this was very little. I mean i openned video but closed it after minute or two. I don't like it where this would end up. I know i can do it I just need to kep on trying and stop focusing that i could fail if i tried something. Also i know that i'm not only one who struggle with life and have problem write on public places but you can do it so I would appreciate if you would find some time to write comment under this.

I don't know where i was going with this whole post it's really not me to post anything anywhere but i need to try to change things i don't like about myself. I will updated this how the whole process of studying advanced or miserable fail.

Your years of experience is unquestionable because your explaining style and approach to solving problems in programming is top notch.

The beginning was really well done, and towards the end you can see that he was somewhat running through the material, but I think that's fine, becasue it give us a small tast of the differant things that you can do with python, so if you find something that interestes you, you can find a more comprihensive course on that specific topic.

"Hi Guys,

I'm trying to write this code for ""Car Game"". I pretty much got everything in place. But I'm stuck at this one area. I added these codes for when the car is stopped and you enter ""go"" it'll respond ""You need to start your car"" and if entered ""go"" after the car has started. Then it'll say ""You will start moving"". But what I'm stuck at is if you were to enter ""go"" again after the car is in motion, I need it to say ""Your car is already in motion!"". Please help.

For this challenge we can use another easy solution(without creating another list), but it will remove the first duplicate number from the list.

for number in numbers :
        if numbers.count(number) > 1 :

"I did the ""For Loops"" exercise differently. 

I did not use a total outside of my loop. 

Here's what I coded, and can someone tell me if it's ""wrong"" even if it prints the same result? 
**
prices = [10, 20, 30]
for cost in prices:
    total = cost + cost 
print(total)


I didn't see a reason to include a total outside of the loop, but was curious if it's ""best practice"" to do so?"

A childhood friend of mine refered me to your sql video on your website =, loved it and decided to take a step back with python and break things down on a fundamental level with your course and you are really good at what you do. 

Your course is way better than the udemy course, lots of notes to take and problems to solve, you should do a C++ and Rust full course as well, would watch in a heartbeat, and btw i am taking my time with this full python course as i dissect the python programming language thanks to you

Keep up the good work brother."

"As I practice with python in, say, Emacs, on Ubuntu, I have noticed it would be very beneficial for learning/retention, if there was a way to add a note to lines of code, say I wanted to explain what this line of code does and why it does it... that way I could see notes as a refresher if I forgot how something functioned or why. So,  I am curious if there is a way to do this in either Emacs, or some other code editing software. I'm just using Emacs because it was the first I tried out. I've been copy pasting things to GoogleDocs and just putting notes by it in a different text color, as I learn, but I find this time consuming. Very very noobie question, so pardon my ignorance. Just kinda curious how people deal with this kind of thing."

"So, my brief story of how I got here and why I'm interested in this... I currently work on a farm which is getting harder in middle age. But I get MONTHS off a year and unemployment for the off season (someones gotta grow your food!). This doesn't pay much. Minimum wage. Then 55% of that during the off season!  I did my A+ Network+ and Server 2003 certs way back in 2008 while in college for IT, which I dropped due to the colleges horrid reputation so stigmatizing no employers would consider me, and then did a 5 year honours BA in English. I couldn't find any work other than minimum wage coffee shop jobs, security etc due to lack of experience in IT and the bad reputation my college had, etc. Even the local big name computer shop demanded 5 years proven experience for minimum wage entry level IT work.

Late in 2016 I found a cheap country house for just 15k, which turned out to be a good friends old family homestead, I was working industrial security crazy hours a week, decided to move into the house which had no running water or toilet for my first 2 years and 4.5 months. Moved here because a friend gave up his farm job, and knew the farmer would give me a shot. So while doing security, I took some winter days to come prune apple trees with a chainsaw (winter I only worked 40hrs a week in security, so had some days to travel the 220km away to the house I'd bought and try this farm job). Been working a farm job 40km from my home for 5 years. Got running water with a drilled well. Built myself a sewer system and a bathroom which the house never had (had to use a bucket!, then a plastic outhouse I'd bought eventually). Now trying to figure my life out. Been using PCs since age 4 or 5.

People keep telling me LEARN TO CODE, work from home! But I'm in my mid 30s almost mid to late 30s. Trying to refresh my IT skills. Built a new PC back in December 2021 while off work from the farm using money from some side work I'd gotten and using a 1070ti GPU I got dirt dirt cheap from a friends bitcoin miner he gave up on using. So here I am. Wondering what the heck to do with my middle aged life, thinking... maybe I should try learning code? I barely remember my IT stuff these days, hence the refreshing I'm trying to do. I remembered enough to build my own machine again of course and maintain things myself, but my knowledge is getting hazy and out dated. Every job I apply for, be it English tutoring for ESL, or even local jobs at any wage level, I never get replies. You contact them, they say they got the staff they need or that if you've applied you'll hear back from them if they're interested. So I have been stuck in this over educated and underpaid wage slave state of life a long time, trying to figure out what I can do, maybe from home (since I live in more remote area... I do have high speed internet etc), to earn a better living that won't destroy my body like the farm does (hurt my back a few years ago and it's never been quite the same, so that job gets harder each year). Everyone says there are loads of jobs, but I've been reading about the issue of ""ghost jobs"" on job banks, for instance, wherein job postings are continually posted and renewed even when employers aren't looking for people, so they always have potential candidate applications coming in if someone should happen to quit or be fired."

It took me about 12 hours to actually get through it cus I kept pausing and going back to make sure I got all the things right. I feel like I've been on a big journey the last 4 or so days I've been working through this. It's not just the basic logic of how programming works like the def functions and like tupls, lists and dictionarys and stuff but also the extra stuff like anaconda navigator and the jupyter editor and bootstrap that has all the website components already written out. I really can not thank you enough Mosh. You said at the end there for us to post the kind of projects I'd like to do.. My current goal is to set up a site that takes a spreadsheet that has the delivery information for lot's of drivers to deliver and turn it into a site that just shows each driver what their jobs are tomorrow.

Can i use Python for data analysis?
I have tried my way to teach python : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw-Jf187DZk
"Idk if i'm just smarter than mosh or if i cheated but for the exercise at 2:00:00 , i did it in 2 lines of code. Someone tell me if im doing this the wrong way or if this is a good way to do this.
 my code:

numbers = [3, 6, 2, 8, 14, 4, 9 ]
print(max(numbers))"
"Thank you sooooo muchhhhhhhh for your great effort for us.

🌃 🛐"
"the exercise in minute 1:55:44 can be solved as follow 

numbers = [5,2,5,2,2]

for i in range(len(numbers)):
    print (numbers[i]*'X')

OR 

for i in numbers:
    print (i*'X')

in this way you have complexity O(n) instead of O(n^2)"
"course is very good. After watching this, I bought Python mastery as recommended by Mosh. The way Mosh explains gets you interest. Kudos and thanks for providing this course"

"Firstly, thank you for the great tutorial! Secondly, I've got a question about the task in 1:39:00, the car game. In the 6th line you have added ""if started"" and the result is ""Car is already started"". I do not understand how. For me, ""if started"" means the state in the 2nd line: started = false, so the car should not be started and the program should not print that the car is already started. If anybody could explain me this a bit more in detail I'd be really grateful:)"

"For checking whether the car is started, instead of using a boolean I used an integer. So if my variable start_count was < 1, then it would display ""car started"", but then add 1 to start_count. So when I'd try to start the car again, it would read it as being >= 1, and so respond with the message ""car already started"".

Then if I selected stop, it would stop the car and reset start_count to 0."

"Hi, I'm a high school student in the States and I'm learning Python for medical statistics. My dream job is to become a biochemical engineer and I've just realized that knowing how to code is essentially important because I will be doing statistical works in the future."

Hi Mosh I just want to say thank you for all your hard work because without you my coding journey wouldn't have the start that it needed. I'm currently in high school and my dream is to be a video game developer. You've helped out millions and I'm incredibly grateful for what you have done. You are amazing

"There is a problem in the weight project :

"He says as a coder you need to predict possible future errors and yet in his tutorials he just blazes through his little coding on his macbook and doesnt really take the time to cater to the overwhelming majority of python coders who use windows and not mac. For instance, when you get to the part of the tutorial where he shows you how to iterate over and excel file, he doesnt explain that because youre on windows, python is going to put a little question mark over the excel file he gives you because it doesnt know what the file is. Youll then have to go search through google and learn about the pandas library and how to install xlsx reader and viewer and all of this other headache inducing nonsense that there is barely any explanation for. This is such a good tutorial series in its own right but the fact that he does it all from a mac and just says hay if youre using windows(which most people are) I have no idea what this is going to look like for you but good luck figuring it out on your own because thats totally the whole reason youre watching a tutorial in the first place right."
great course.

Used to be a COBOL programmer hundreds of years ago so Python syntax user friendly.  However the solutions bring up new key words like unique that were never taught in that module so stuck most exercises.  Unable to download his transaction file and each time he constructs the solution he deletes it off and confuses what he has previously said.  He should stick to the one conclusion.  The machine part of this again goes into different directions.  Obviously lots of views and only one of many tutorial to watch to understand fully.  Not user friendly in my opinion.

"On the car engine program, i copied the code that you wrote down word for word so as to correct my code. When i execute the copied code, it only tells me it doesn't understand no matter what command i execute. My code i initially wrote works better as it only manages to make some functions work but not all of them. This has created a knowledge gap as i wouldn't know how to write code for similar programs. Is this a problem that is a result of a fault in the pycharm software or is it something else"

If command.lower() == ""start"":
    Print(""car started..."") That makes sense to me but 
Command = """"
While command.lower() != ""quit"": 
Does not. What does != mean what does it mean to ""not equal to"" like how does quit make the program quit. I don't see the code that makes ""quit"" quit the program I mean he explains it at 1:37:00 to 1:37:13 but i don't know what he's trying to say to me and I still don't understand"
1:30:07 I don't understand why += 1 is there. He explained it briefly but I still don't understand why you have to put it there.

"@Programming with Mosh for the challenge in Nested Loops, I attempted it and got the correct output, but the code is different. The code that I made is:

numbers = [5,2,5,2,2]
strs = 'x'
for number in numbers:
    for str in strs:
        var = str*number
        print(f'{var}')

Can we do it this way as well?"

"Thanks Mosh, I had started another course and was feeling overwhelmed. I have watched this for just 26 mins and feeling confident and newly motivated. I like your way of explaining things, thanks for doing this."
"There's an even shorter way of achieving the challenge @ 01:47:46

numbers = [5, 2, 5, 2, 2]

for i in numbers:
    for j in range(i):
        print('x', end='')
    print()


You don't need to build the string in the external loop, you can just tell the print function to not print on a new line in the internal loop by using the end='' (two ', not a speech mark) and using an empty print to call a new line for the next iteration :)"

"Hi guys, i have a problem. I am following the video and try to do the assigned tasks in the code editor. So far so good until the string methods tutorial (40:50- 48.33). For some reason when I run the program it does not return the print(course.upper)) and the other string methods. Instead it returns the print(10/3) command  from the Arithemtic Operations tutorial even if meanwhile I deleted it. Take  alook:

here is the editing:

weight = input(""What is your weight? "")
print(""Your weight is "" + weight +"" lbs"")
kilo_weight = int(weight) * 0.45
print(""Your weight in kgs is:"" +str(kilo_weight))
message = ''' Hi Vladimir,

print(message)

print(course[0])
print(course[0:3]) # primele trei caractere, adica 0,1,2, fara 3
another = course[:]
print(another)

# formated string
first = ""Bogdi""
last = ""Ivascu""
msg = f'{first} {last} is a master coder'
print(msg)
print(course.upper())
print(course.lower())

"Hello Mosh.

Following your lesson I got an error after submitting the form on 5:42:11.
The error is this
OperationalError at /admin/products/product/add/
no such table: main.auth_user__old

I search for it on google and I found that maybe the django version 2.1 you are using has a bug.

To help the others:
1. Open your terminal and write
    1. pip install django==2.1.5
    2. Press enter
2. Open your PyShop folder
3. Open db.sqlite3 file, delete its contents and save
4. Open Terminal and write
    1. python3 manage.py makemigrations
    2. Press enter
    3. python3 manage.py migrate
    4. Press enter
    5. python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    6. Press enter and write your username, email, password
5. Now everything working fine!

"Im learning python at an early age (14), As my brain is developing i want to stick programming languages into it, with that i can also learn python at an early age without struggling through adulthood, Now what matters now is the effort I will put into, the hardest thing is to stay motivated throughout learning how to program, This is good for me because i feel like programming is getting fun for me, i've recently created a website using html. My main focus is just to accelerate through the fundamentals of learning how to program."
"Hello Mosh, your course is fantastic and easy to understand for beginners like me. I am a Digital Marketer who has experience in Google Ads and Analytics. I'd like to know the applications/opportunities of python for Marketing or analytics."
Thank you Mosh. I just bought your course on complete python mastery a few days ago. Really learning cool stuffs and I am happy. Hope to achieve my goals soon when I complete the course. Thanks once more and looking forward to learning more from you
Just take a bow 🙌 👏 for this amazing video sir...
Sir I need some python pdf to improve my skills
"I am also going to watch and follow this course Mosh! Like the MySQL, I feel already cool - using Python. I once begun with a book (a well known) but due to circumstances I got stuck in the middle of the book. I believe this is going to end so well. Mostly I need Python for data processing, reporting, and analysis in combination to Excel , not that much for designing Websites, but I will follow everything."

"hey there, i wrote an alternative for the ""remove duplicates in a list"" program (2:12:06), just wanted to know what do you think about it.

numbers=[2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 9, 4, 6, 10, 13, 3]
for i in numbers:   

    if numbers.count(i)>1:
        numbers.remove(i)
    else:
        continue
print(numbers) 



i personally think it's better than the one Mosh wrote, cause it actually removes the duplicates in the same list, without even needing to create a new list, and it  uses more string methods, making it better for testing immediately after watching the tutorial section."

Basically, I am a wet lab scientist but really want to python to write different codes that will help me analyze the huge dataset.

Hi now a days Python is one of the most skill in it fields I like to learn python you teach and explain very well..thank u 😊
"1:39:45 im confused here
where the part

started = False
while True:
   command = input(""> "").lower()
   if command == ""start"":
	   if started:
			print(""Car is already started!!"")
he set the variable started to false
but the bool he made is
if started as false/no then print(""Car already started!!"")
i thought false was same as No
so the thing confused me is
if started as false
then the print should be is
the car started, not already

please anyone who can help me in this confusion tell me explain it that even dumb like me could understand"

I already know the basics of programming and I was looking for a short video on overview of python basics then I came across to this video.

you can play hangman with this code. I wonder how you would be able to draw each line for each wrong guess.
"I learned that with the while loop, you don't put the input at the beginning, but after the while loop. Interesting. I tested it by putting it at the beginning and it executed only once vs inside the while loop, it executes multiple times."

    conversion = (temperature - 32)/1.8

"Hello Mosh, 
Thank you very much for the great course. 
When creating my package and accessing the shipping module, my system does not give the same pop up access as yours does. 
When checking and redo it several times, I can see when you create the packages, your __init__ file is a python file and one can see the logo of pyhton. However, when I do the same (either create it manually or using the package option in pycharm), my init file is not converted to python at least it doesn't show the python file format. 
As a result, when I try to access the module, ecommerce package works well but after that, when I write dot, no more option is provided. 
What do you think could cause this?"

"12:59
At the time I'm writing this comment, I'll be entering my senior year in high school. I want to become a game designer in the future, but the career I have to study for that in university is software engineering. I've tried with many resources to learn programming and ultimately I give up because I always get stuck at some point or another and I'm scared, maths have never been my strong suit and that's what's been keeping me skeptical of my future: I'm understanding everything but should I simply bury my dream because I'm not good at maths? 
I've been dreaming with big languages like C# and C++, but I need to humble myself and start with the basics first. I've already tried HTML, CSS and did a 3-week basic course on Javascript. I had a lot of fun with those, so I expect Python to be the same! 
I'll try my best to not give up on Python this time and I want to thank you so much, Mr. Mosh, for making simple to follow tutorials for such a scaredy-cat noob like me."

"Mosh, thank you so much for this video. You're helping people including me learn programming free of charge. You're amazing."
"SPOILER FOR LIST METHODS EXERCISE:









Not sure if anyone will see this but I managed to remove the duplicates using a different set of code that Mosh taught in this lesson:

numbers = [2, 2, 4, 6, 3, 4, 6, 1]
numbers2 = numbers.copy()

for duplicate in numbers:
    if numbers2.count(duplicate) > 1:
        numbers2.remove(duplicate)

numbers2.sort()
print(numbers2)

The use of the sort method was just preference and isn't required to remove the duplicates.

Hopefully this helps someone :)"

For the exercise in the List Methods section, the problem is to remove duplicates and my answer was a bit different from the solution. Would this be acceptable?

"After 2.5 years, I am returning here to say that I’ve just accepted a job offer for a good salary, and my IT journey started here, from this video, in November of 2019. This was my first source of information, when I got back from work (being a cable tech), and typed “Python full course” or something along those lines. 

Of course, back then, a lot of concepts like classes and inheritance meant nothing to me, and this video perhaps wasn’t the most beginner friendly. However, I was so sick of my job and I absolutely saw no growth in doing cable, where the salary cap for a technician was probably IT jobs base pay for the most part, so I decided to Google every single thing I don’t understand. 

And I successfully changed careers."

"Just a heads up for project #2, you might have to disable your antivirus if it's running in the background. Prevented anaconda from downloading properly for me

also at 4:50:35 for model persistence, type ""conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn"" into your anaconda command prompt and then ""y"" to install the LATEST version.  Then simply type ""import joblib"" on Jupyter notebooks and it should work just fine!

also also, if you were getting user warnings earlier on when building and fitting the model, append "".values"" to the method's parameters 

will take this opportunity to sincerely thank Mosh for this 6h coding journey! it's been quite a treat"

I put the excel file in my project, and when I am in PyCharm, I can see it on the left, where all the files are displayed, but the file has a question mark besides it. After some research online, some people are saying that it is because Python does not recognize this file type (.xlsx).
But when I go into settings  > editor > file type > Files opened in associated applications, I can see the *.xlsx in the file name patterns. I don't really understand what the * means so maybe that's the problem or something? Not sure what to do. I can't really find any info about this issue on the internet."

I still got the correct result but in case you are like me and want to remove the warning I believe it is because the new version of sklearn does not like that you are attempting to fit a set of data containing only values to names. Changing model.fit(X, y) to model.fit(X.values, y.values) fixes this."

"I’d like to make a point about Dictionaries, as it’s not mentioned in either the Youtube course or the Python Mastery course. Let’s say that a particular key does not exist in a Dictionary object. If you try to access a value for the corresponding key that does not exist, you will get a Key Error. For example, suppose you have a Dictionary called test_dict and try to execute print(test_dict[“a”]), where “a” is not already a key in test_dict. This will generate the Key Error. As Mosh points out this can be avoided by using the Dictionary object’s get() method. With the same assumptions, print(test_dict.get(“a”)) will print None to the console, and print(test_dict.get(“a”, 0)) will print 0 to the console. In neither case, however, will the key “a” with the corresponding value be added to test_dict. In contrast, the Dictionary setdefault() method has the same effect as get() when accessing a value for a nonexistent key, but, it will also actually add the key and its value to the Dictionary object. For instance, suppose the key “b” does not exist. The result of the expression print(test_dict.setdefault(“b”, 0)) is BOTH to print 0 to the console AND to add the key/value pair “b”:0 to test_dict. If the second argument to the setdefault() method is omitted, the value for the “b” key will be None."

With the help of your video I have been able to get into the depths of python programming and I have learnt from this video so much that I found an alternate way of solving the problem of removing duplicates without the second empty list. I want to show how much your teaching has actually been teaching people :- 


row = [6, 3, 2, 7, 2, 1, 6, 8, 3, 5, 7, 1]

for number in row:
    if row.count(number) > 1:

this code removes the duplicates from the list without the need of a second list."

This comment is mainly for the viewers not for Mosh cuz there is nothing he can do legally to a copycat of this nature, this phenomenon of ripping out video ideas and even content between programmers is crazy, and also dangerous, filling the resources websites (blogs/YouTube) with redundant content, and more importantly stealing the blood sweat and tears a person has put into creating their content!!! and you, the viewer is the only way to fight that by disliking and reporting, I was looking for Mosh's course to share with a friend and clicked the copycat's thumbnail by mistake, I think it worked for him because I believe that's one of the things he was monetizing his views on ….. its really really really really bad to see people of this nature now entering the dev community .. it used to be clean and trust worthy before all those waves of so called entrepreneurs started taking programming courses … the amount of amature code out there that is written as a ""hustle"" or ""homework"" being used in production by millions is a collection of garbage (not to be confused with garbage collection term) is insane ... because these guys are treating github as a social media now, getting stars and followers is what's important ... and the project with most stars live, and that explains why stuff like most those frontend frameworks are popular and widely used while everything about them is mostly far from optimal. if you are taking this you are most likely new, and if you are new, please don't fall into hypes and marketing, this is a community of inventors not sales men ....."

Sir, here I wanted to test the code with some decimal number. So I decided to wrote 110.231 (50kg is the output) but since I used the 'int' conversion command infront of the string, it immediately pointed out the error but if I removed the decimals and just wrote 110 it gave the correct output.

**So with the 'int' command we can't actually give a decimal number as input.**

That's why I used 'float' in place of 'int' and got the correct output which is 50 kgs (well 49.99994053747kgs) when I gave the number 110.231 as input. I also tested it without decimals and it worked perfectly fine.

**Hence, I feel using float gives the users a freedom to type either a whole number or decimal number which is not the case with 'int'.**

total=0
for price in prices :
  total += price
print(f""Total {total}"")

my question is : why did u create new variable ""total""?"
"number = [5, 2, 4, 1, 5, 3, 2, 2, 4, 6, 1]

for item in number:
    if number.count(item) > 1:
        number.remove(item)
print(number)"

1:43:24 for the item in python why did it print P Y T H O N one by one
1:40:30 why do we write IF statement 2 times
1:32:58 what is that exclamation mark mean
"You're looking to move into a new apartment on specific street, and you're given a list of contiguous blocks on that street where
each block contains an apartment that you could move into.

You also have a list of requirements: a list of buildings that are important to you. For instance, you might value having a school and
a gym near your apartment. The list of blocks that you have contains information at every block about all of the buildings that are
present and absent at the block in question. For instance, for every block, you might know whether a school, a pool, an office, and a
gym are present.

In order to optimize your life, you want to pick an apartment block such that you minimize the farthest distance you'd have to walk
from your apartment to reach any of your required buildings.

Write a function that takes in a list of contiguous blocks on a specific street and a list of your required buildings and that returns
the location (the index) of the block that's most optimal for you.

If there are multiple most optimal blocks, your function can return the index of any one of them.

Sample Input
blocks = [
{
    ""gym"": False,
    ""school"": True,
    ""store"": False,
},
{
    ""gym"": True,
    ""school"": False,
    ""store"": False,
},
{
    ""gym"": True,
    ""school"": True,
    ""store"": False,
},
{
    ""gym"": False,
    ""school"": True,
    ""store"": False,
},
{
""gym"": False,
""school"": True,
""store"": True,
}
]
reqs = [""gym"", ""school"", ""store""]

Sample Output
3 // at index 3, the farthest you'd have to walk to reach a gym, a school, or a store is 1 block; at any other index, you'd have to walk farther

Could you please give solution explanation"

JVM DLL ERRORS IVE TRIED EVERY SINGLE TUTORIAL BUT NOTHING
Literally What i need
"There are alots of python tutorials you’ll find on youtube but i strongly recommend to watch this python for beginners 6 hour course.
Why I'm saying this. Let me tell you a short story. I have completed my MS degree in Telecommunication and Networking where programming was our core subject But believe i don't know how i pass those programming subjects. I was so scared of for while loops i didn't even know that what was module. When i completed my MS degree in 2019 i started learning python language its not because i choose it but one of my friend told me that python is the simplest language in all languages. I bought python books, i watched multiple python tutorials. I talked to different tutors but still the result was zero. Then i thought that I'm not fit for this field.
This month i was just browsing on YouTube and i came to one hour python for beginners tutorial of mosh and after that one hour tutorial i started this 6 hour tutorial and now after 2 weeks i have just completed 4 hours of this course.
I never thought that programming will be that easy. After i completing this course i am buying mosh beginner to advance python course. 
I believe that not everyone can teach you but there is only one person who knows how to teach something.
If you are new to programming and you want to learn python i strongly recommend you to watch this tutorial. You will thank me later."

"I'm probably going to keep adding comments but here we go. First comment: I don't care if this was uploaded in 2019. I went to a subscription platform that offered a free beginner's Python course. The first lesson was not for beginners. There was no intro on what to do if you have Windows or Mac. The guy just went straight to an Ubuntu VM and started coding. I wasn't lost because I have tech knowledge and knew where he was working from but if that's how he's going to start I don't want anything to do with it. I don't program so I want it to be as simple as possible to start. That was not it. After searching around I found an article that listed the ten best places to learn Python online and this was the only YouTube channel mentioned. I found that very interesting. It says something. Anyway, I am not very far along, but I wanted to stop and comment in case people were as frustrated finding a class/tutorial, etc. that a beginner can follow.

This is what I came up with for the weight problem:
weight = input('How many pounds do you weigh? ')
conversion = (int(weight) * 0.45359237)
print(conversion)
It did not occur to me to create a variable called weight_kg but conversion is what I did to get it in kg. So I ran it and was pretty pleased with myself. 😊

Whoops! Didn't think to use the curly braces on the If Then exercise. Something to remember."

 for item in ['xxxxx', 'xx', 'xxxxx', 'xx', 'xx',]:
    print(item)

output - 
XXXXX
XX
XXXXX
XX
XX"

"***ADVICE NEEDED***

@Programming with Mosh There is something in the Car Game that I just can't seem to wrap my head around - I'm very fresh into coding so apologies if my description lacks the correct terminology! - or if I'm missing the whole point here :

When using the 'started' variable. If we are stating that 'started' = 'False' before entering our While loop - why does the:

'if started:
print(""Car already started"")



Code seem to make the program think that it is True?

When I'm reading through the loop, it looks like 'started' only becomes a True Boolean value when the  'Car started' print message is triggered, further down the code.


My confusion is that if this is the first contact that Python has with that Variable in the while loop, wouldn't it be recognized as False, because it's default state before the Loop started was of that Boolean value?

My program works fine, I'm just struggling to understand it logically enough to actually use it intuitively.

Hopefully this made some sort of sense, and any help is appreciated!
Cheers, 
Chris J"

I found a way around this by going into Jupyter and then clicking, ""Upload"".
After that you can simply click your csv file.
After opening the .ipynb you just have to use the code(I'm showing the code Mosh used):
import pandas as pd
df = pandas.read_csv(""nameofthecsvfile.csv"")
df

and BOOM. it worked."

"So if one list equals another list, then they are forever linked, but variables are not like this, right?


For example in this case:

x=0
y=x
x=3
print(y) will print 0, because y was defined y=x=0 before x was changed to 3.

But:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers2 = numbers

numbers.append(3)

print(numbers2) gives 1, 2, 3, 4, 3

So does this mean that lists are not affected by the sequence of commands the same way as variables?


EDIT: Corrected to 'numbers2 = numbers' (instead of 'numbers.copy()' )"

"Just to add, I have completed the final Django course with version 4.0.4 instead of 2.1 and Mosh codes works same in the higher version of Django. The only issue you will get is the import os module missing on settings.py at 06:11:10 , so you need to add that manually
Also if your webpage is not loading in Django ensure that you run "" python manage.py runserver "" on the console and leave it untouched. I accidently stopped that and was wondering where my wesbite was. So if your site is missing just run "" python manage.py runserver "" on your pycharm console and you'll be fine"

"Hello Mosh,
Great Video.
Thanks for this helpful video.
But when I run the program for the For Loops i got the result as 
Total: 10
Total: 30
Total: 60

Whereas, as you said I was supposed to get

Total: 60

I have checked the program a lot of times but I couldn't figure this problem out.
This is my code:

prices = [10, 20, 30]

total = 0
for price in prices:
    total += price
    print(f""Total: {total}"")

I hope you would reply back soon."

"since you asked for my story (and i dare to hope this wasn't just to push this video in the yt algorythm): i'm highly sensitive. basically what that means is most things get on my nerves and/or stress me out (most things, as in direct sunlight or brightly lit surfaces, many outside sounds like car tires on the road, wind blowing around my head, you get the picture. and yeah, it's fucked up). i need a job where i don't have to leave the house or meet other people and i need the money pretty badly. 
i tried studying computer science but i didn't get far. i learned some basic java though. i know that's valuable for a job in the industry and i wanted to get better at it but i just don't like it. i think it's inefficient. so python was my next best choice"
Thanks Mosh :)

I'm so happy because you said that it is so challenging, but i did it. Thank Mosh for such great exercises! ❤

Code:

for number in numbers:
    string = """"

Python and
"Hi Mosh - you asked why I want to learn Python. I spent much of my working life with computers, writing SGML, XML and HTML as well as writing UNIX scripts to manipulate libraries of files and do multiple edits on file libraries. At the age of 73 I am unwilling to let my brain atrophy and so Python - as simple as that"
L
you vsauce egghead
I must say that you really helped spike my interest in learning python. Thank you so much.
Hello mosh my name is Keith harisson omondi i just wanna say thanks for this video you have no idea how greatly i appreciate this
"Hello All
,
am getting error while adding new products from the page.
I don't know how to solve this problem, Please help me with this"
6:06 i dont have pyhton 3.7 i only had 3 and 2.7
"47
54:21 the question's answer"
"Hi Mosh, a few minutes before I had posted a  doubt, I resolved it.  For others who want to know the answer, here is the code:

weight = input('Weight: ')
unit = input('Unit [(L)bs or (K)gs]: ')

lbs_1 = 'l'
kgs_1 = 'k'
lbs_2 = 'L'
kgs_2 = 'K'

if unit == lbs_1 or lbs_2 and not kgs_1 and kgs_2:
    weight_in_kgs = round(float(weight) / 2.205)
    print(f'Your weight in kgs: {weight_in_kgs}')

elif unit == kgs_1 or kgs_2 and not lbs_1 and lbs_2:
    weight_in_lbs = round(float(weight) * 2.205)
    print(f'Your weight in lbs: {weight_in_lbs}')"
"Hi Mosh, this video has helped me a lot. I tried doing the weight converter program it worked when the unit was in pounds but not when it was kilograms. This is my code:

weight = input('Weight: ')
unit = input('Unit [(L)bs or (K)gs]: ')

l = 'l'
k = 'k'
L = 'L'
K = 'K'

if unit == l or L:
    weight_in_kgs = float(weight) // 2.205
    print(f'Your weight in kgs: {weight_in_kgs}')

else:
    weight_in_lbs = float(weight) * 2.205
    print(f'Your weight in lbs: {weight_in_lbs}')

So could you please tell me how it can be corrected."

"At the weight converter program. Dont you need to use the ""elif"" command instead of ""else""? Because if now somone enters ""O"" instead of ""K"" for example, the program would still show a weight in Kilos even though you entered the wrong command during unit input. So you would rather create an ""elif"" command for ""K"" entry and an ""else"" command that prints an error message for any input different than ""K"" or ""L"", or am I wrong? Otherwise a real masterpiece of tutorial. Very very helpful"
I can proudly say that there some good person also in this cruel world i am just 17 and so worried about my career because i went to school and stop at 8th standard because of some personal problems but after knowing some information about software engineering and java script and all i came to python now i feel sooo lucky just because of you mosh thanks for all of this i pray that you achieve a lot in your life stay bless and thank you soo much for this you are a real life hero💚💚💚💚💚💚💚

hi
I am a newbie in the Machine learning field and Python programming. I am currently carrying a Machine Learning research work for my final year undergraduate project and I would appreciate a topic suggestion on simple AI/ML model. Thanks!
i like to study data science as my career path..i think python will help me for this
I AM A STUDENT
"Really enjoying this course!  I can't believe it's free!! 😀 Btw, how do you add an additional tab in Pycharm??"
After login in mine is not coming in as create new python file but rather it jumps straight into the work area and thereby codings occurs already in a form of already done work
You had me up until the guess game.  I can't figure out how to get my game to run the same way.  I only have main.py as well and no app.py
"i have been following a udemy course for 2-3 weeks now, waiting for them to get into loops and details and handling data, but i'm not completely satisfied (even though the course is GREAT and the instructor is too). 2 hours into this video and i got a lot of the stuff that i wanted and it's really helpful, but again, not exactly what i need. it explains basics very well, but i need more handling of actually dataframes and columns, and processing real world problems in if/for/while loops (maybe it's coming up ahead?)

anyone reading, any suggestions ... i struggle with self-made functions/loops. REAL WORLD data, intermediate/advanced level, not beginner material"
if else with not started made no sense to me in car game. welp!!
"Hi Mosh, for me i have been in customer service for 6 years but i'm ready to change my career to data analysis, that is why i'm here"

"Here was my weight converter code before seeing the solution:

weight = int(input('Weight:'))

fav_color = input(""And your favorite color? "")
print(name, ""Likes"", fav_color)

name = input(""What's your name? "")
fav_color = input(""And your favorite color? "")
print(name + ""Likes"" + fav_color)

"For the ""duplicates"" challenge in the List Methods I came up with a different method. Instead of adding to another list (I like to call it memory), I removed the variable from the existing list if it had greater than one value. Rather than removing subsequent instances, it deleted the instance until there was only one left. I thought it was interesting how it did the same thing but different.
This is how it looked:

for value in numbers:
___duplicates = numbers.count(value)
___if duplicates = > 1:
______numbers.remove(value)"

"I'm nearly 15 and thought coding is an opportunity for me. I want to study in programming and 14 seems the perfect age to start as us as young adults are really interested in computers. I have seen some comments and see 10 and 11 year olds trying this. I would suggest to leave it a few years as you are a bit young and won't soak it up properly and by the time your 14 you could stop for a while before or even forget alot of it. 14-17 is when our brains are most active and so is our bodies becuase of school and growth etc. Kids, leave it until you're about 14-15 happy coding."

I think if Started is initially set to false then for if started statement here is false (that is car has not started) then why are we printing here that the car is started first.
I guess we should write ""car started"" first. Whatever is the logic kindly explain it as soon as possible.

"What is the benefit of using a formatted string instead of for example, using a string and then + and a variable?"
"Aside from the difference between adding or omitting a space, are there any other functional differences between these two methods of print?

Still an absolutely amazing video and very valuable for new programmers like me, thank you so much!"
